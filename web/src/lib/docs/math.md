# Math
Note: We currently only support additions and subtractions, this page will update once more is supported /
You can perform math operations on numbers and variables.

```rust
let a = 5;
let b = -5;
let c = a - b;

print(a);
print(b);
print(c);

// Outputs
//
// 5
// -5
// 10
```

You can use '+' to join strings, like this:
```rust
let a = "Hello,";

print(a + " World!");
```

This should output "Hello, World!"
